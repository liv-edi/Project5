## Project 5

In this project we created a Monster game using classes that gave the monsters an initial life value and min. life value for the monster to be alive. When the game ran the monster's life is drained by a random amount and went on until all of the monsters had died.

Technologies used for this project:
- VSCode
- Node.js

The purpose of this project was to gain experience working with classes, including class constructors and methods, interpreting existing code to design a new class, working with code modules, executing/writing Node.js code using VSCode, including module breakpoints, working with gaming loops, and working with objects and arrays.

I did not do this project.
